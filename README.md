### 2. Facial Recognition for Missing Person Identification

- **Objective:**  
  Implement a facial recognition system for real-time identification of missing persons, which supports prompt intervention by authorities.

- **Methodology:**  
  Employs OpenCV and face recognition libraries to detect and encode facial features. The system compares captured encodings with a stored target using a 0.6 similarity threshold, processing every alternate frame to balance efficiency with detection accuracy.  
  **Key Features:**  
  - **Real-Time Processing**
  - **Multi-threaded Email Alerts** upon positive detection

- **Impact:**  
  Enhances search operations and supports law enforcement by providing quick and reliable missing person identification.

### 3. Violence Detection System Using YOLO11s-Pose and XGBoost

- **Objective:**  
  Detect violent incidents and suspicious activities on roads to facilitate timely emergency responses.

- **Methodology:**  
  Leverages the YOLO11s-pose model for pose estimation to capture human posture data, coupled with an XGBoost classifier to evaluate the likelihood of violence. The system analyzes every 3rd frame for efficiency and considers predictions with a confidence score above 0.55.  
  **Key Features:**  
  - **Pose Estimation:** Extracts keypoints and bounding boxes for individuals.
  - **Automated Alerts:** Initiates real-time alerts and visual annotations on video frames.
  - **Scalable Detection:** Supports continuous video monitoring with minimal computational overhead.

- **Impact:**  
  Improves public safety by automating the identification of violent incidents and facilitating quick emergency responses.

### 4. Incident Severity Prediction Model

- **Objective:**  
  Predict the severity of incidents based on descriptive text, thereby aiding authorities in prioritizing responses effectively.

- **Methodology:**  
  Implements TF-IDF for feature extraction from incident descriptions, followed by a machine learning classifier trained on a self-made dataset of over 10,000 records derived from Indian crime history.  
  **Key Features:**  
  - **Advanced NLP Techniques:** TF-IDF and ML algorithms to evaluate textual data.
  - **Comprehensive Dataset:** Over 10,000 incident records for robust model training.
  - **Actionable Insights:** Offers severity scores to prioritize emergency responses.
